  Comprehensive file system operations tool. 
  
  REQUIRED: Always specify the 'operation' parameter (one of: read, write, list, exists, stat, mkdir, rm, mv, cp).
  
  Examples:
  - To list a directory: {"operation": "list", "path": "/path/to/dir"}
  - To read a file: {"operation": "read", "path": "/path/to/file"}
  - To check if path exists: {"operation": "exists", "path": "/path"}
